# cgtk3

This is a Swift package manager module map for GTK+ 3.

## Usage

To use this in a package add the dependency to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
.Package(url: "https://github.com/sclukey/cgtk3.git", majorVersion: 1)
```

## Versioning

The tags of this package don't follow the versions of GTK because [this](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/blob/master/Documentation/Usage.md#module-map-versioning) says not to.
